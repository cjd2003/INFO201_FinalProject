# INFO201_FinalProject
Analysis of Spotify songs to provide directions of new and current musical artists done for a final project for INFO 201. 

This report serves as a guide for anybody already in or wanting to join the music industry. Throughout our guide, we address three key questions: What are the most popular music genres? Is there a relationship between the rise of artists and popular genres? What are the basic elements of a song that could result in it becoming a popular song?

Our guide provides people with yearly societal trends as well as giving them information on which genre and artists seem to do the best throughout the years. From this, they can base their next piece of work on the influence provided by our guide. Our guide will also include measurements of different basic elements that are used in song-making. These measurements include mode, valence/energy, and the duration of the song. We have included many graphs with data for each question from our group so that our audience can easily understand the results. With these results, they can make comparisons based on the years to predict what future trends are going to be like.

From our study, we ultimately found that for success in the music industry, you will have the best chances if you create a song that falls under the genres of dance and hip-hop. The song should be around three minutes and thirty seconds and should include lyrics with a beat that conveys deep and raw emotions, preferably in a major mode.
